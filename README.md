Cross-platform Property List (plist) editor written in Rust.

Currently does not support manual arrangement of entries, only sorting using the right click context menu option. Also, due to a technical limitation `âŒ˜+Q` on macOS will close the application even if there are unsaved changes.

Support for flushing (snapshotting) OpenCore EFI folder data to config.plist coming soon.
