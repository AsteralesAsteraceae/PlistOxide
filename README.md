Cross-platform Property List (plist) editor written in Rust.

Currently does not support manually rearranging of entries, only sorting using the option inside the right click context menu.

Due to a technical limitation `âŒ˜+Q` on macOS cannot be prevented from closing the application when there are unsaved changes.

OpenCore configuration snapshot support coming soon.
